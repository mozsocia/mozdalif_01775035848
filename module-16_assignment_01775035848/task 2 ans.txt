Task 2:


Within the project, create a new migration file named "create_products_table" that will be responsible for creating a table called "products" in the database. The "products" table should have the following columns:


id: an auto-incrementing integer and primary key.


name: a string column to store the product name.


price: a decimal column to store the product price.


description: a text column to store the product description.


created_at: a timestamp column to store the creation date and time.


updated_at: a timestamp column to store the last update date and time.



Answer 2: 

To create a new migration file named "create_products_table" within the Laravel project that will be responsible for creating a "products" table with the specified columns, you can follow these steps:

in the root directory of project ("MigrationAssignment"). Open  command-line interface or terminal. Run the following command to generate a new migration file:

```
php artisan make:migration create_products_table
```

This command will generate a new migration file with the name "create_products_table" in the "database/migrations" directory of project.

Inside the migration file, its contents with the following code:



use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;
use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

class CreateProductsTable extends Migration
{
    /**
     * Run the migrations.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function up()
    {
        Schema::create('products', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->id();
            $table->string('name');
            $table->decimal('price');
            $table->text('description');
            $table->timestamps();
        });
    }

    /**
     * Reverse the migrations.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function down()
    {
        Schema::dropIfExists('products');
    }
}
