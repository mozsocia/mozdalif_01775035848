Question 5:


You are implementing a file upload feature in your Laravel application. Write the code to handle a file upload named 'avatar' in the current request and store the uploaded file in the 'public/uploads' directory. Use the original filename for the uploaded file.


Answer 5:- 
To handle a file upload named 'avatar' in a Laravel controller and store the uploaded file in the 'public/uploads' directory using the original filename:

Controller (UploadController.php):


<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class UploadController extends Controller
{
    public function upload(Request $request)
    {
        if ($request->hasFile('avatar') ) {
            $file = $request->file('avatar');
            $fileName = $file->getClientOriginalName();
            $file->move(public_path('uploads'), $fileName);
            
            //  store the file path in the database if needed

            
            return response()->json(['message' => 'File uploaded successfully']);
        }
        
        return response()->json(['message' => 'Invalid file or file upload failed'], 400);
    }
}


Route web.php code for routing:-

<?php

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;
use App\Http\Controllers\UploadController;

Route::post('/upload', [UploadController::class, 'upload']);
