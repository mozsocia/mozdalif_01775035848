 Answer 3:-

To create a global middleware in Laravel that logs the request method and URL for every incoming request, you can follow these steps:

to generate the middleware:

php artisan make:middleware LogRequestMiddleware



the LogRequestMiddleware.php file and modify its handle method to log the request information. Here's the code

<?php

namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use Closure;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log;

class LogRequestMiddleware
{
    public function handle($request, Closure $next)
    {
        $logMessage = 'Request Method: ' . $request->method() . ', url:' . $request->url().  ', Full URL: ' . $request->fullUrl();
        
        Log::info($logMessage);

        return $next($request);
    }
}

Now to  the app/Http/Kernel.php file and add the LogRequestMiddleware to the $middleware property:


protected $middleware = [
    // Other middleware...
    \App\Http\Middleware\LogRequestMiddleware::class,
];
