Task 1: Request Validation


Implement request validation for a registration form that contains the following fields: name, email, and password. Validate the following rules:


 


name: required, string, minimum length 2.


email: required, valid email format.


password: required, string, minimum length 8.


Answer 1:-


the validation rules
Open the RegistrationController file located in the app/Http/Controllers directory. In the controller file, import the Illuminate\Http\Request class and add a method to handle the registration form submission. In this method, define the validation rules using Laravel's validation rules syntax. Here's an example:


Controller Code (RegistrationController.php):-

<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class RegistrationController extends Controller
{
    public function register(Request $request)
    {

        $validatedData = $request->validate([
            'name' => 'required|string|min:2',
            'email' => 'required|email',
            'password' => 'required|string|min:8',
        ]);

        // Registration logic goes here

        return response()->json(['message' => 'Registration successful']);
    }
}


Route the form submission the routes/web.php :-

<?php

use App\Http\Controllers\RegistrationController;

Route::post('/register', [RegistrationController:class,'register'])->name('register');
